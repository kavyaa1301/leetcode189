# leetcode189
### Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

Example:
text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
### Intuition
Move elements to their correct positions in cycles, handling the case when we return to the starting position.

### Algorithm
python
1. Start from index 0, move element to (i + k) % n
2. Continue until all elements are processed
3. Handle cycles by moving to next starting position
### Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n) - Each element moved exactly once
Space Complexity: O(1) - In-place modification
### Key Takeaways
Problem-Solving Insights
Mathematical Insight is Powerful: The reverse method demonstrates how a deep understanding of array properties can lead to elegant, efficient solutions rather than brute-force approaches.
Modulo Arithmetic is Crucial: The operation k = k % n is essential for handling edge cases where rotation count exceeds array size, preventing unnecessary operations and potential errors.
### Final Thought
The Rotate Array problem is more than just a coding challengeâ€”it's a lesson in elegant problem-solving. The reverse method's beauty lies in its simplicity and efficiency, reminding us that the best solutions often come from understanding fundamental properties rather than applying complex logic.

Remember: Great programmers don't just solve problems; they find the most elegant and efficient ways to solve them. This problem perfectly exemplifies that principle.
In-Place Operations Matter: The constraint to modify the array in-place teaches important lessons about memory efficiency and algorithm optimization.
